# Load Cell Board Mbed OS example using process class
This example shows a sketch of a load cell board firmware responsible for acquiring analog data and sending it to a CAN interface.

## Mbed OS build tools

This example was built using Mbed Studio [https://os.mbed.com/studio/] plus NUCLEO-L476RG board [https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l476rg.html]

After downloading the Mbed Studio, create a new program using this repository.

## Application functionality

The code was compartmentalized with classes to make adding new features easier.

## Building and running

1. Connect a USB cable between the USB port on the board and the host computer.
1. Run the following command to build the example project and program the microcontroller flash memory:

## Expected output
The LED on your target turns on and off every 1 second.


## Troubleshooting
